# Real Estate App

A simple real estate app that allows users to search through homes of their choice and make inqueries to the real estate agent related to that certain property. For the company, it allows easy access to the database and upload or update listings as well add or modify real estate agents onto their website.

# Technology

The frontend of this app was built on React.js using Redux as the state management. Axios was used to make RESTful API requests to the server and retrieve the necessary data. Bootstrap was used for the main designs and SASS was use for any other customizations. For authentication, Django's built-in authentication was used to create and handle tokens and users loggings. React-alert, a third=party package, was use for any popups to alert the user of any errors or confirmations.
